# Liquid-simulations
## Project VII (medium)
Develop a C++ code for simulating, in a cubic box of volume V , N particles interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential with a cutoff radius equal to 2.5â€€ in the NVT(canonical) and NPT (isobaric)ensembles, then:
1. Carry out several simulations in the NPT ensemble at ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T= k_BT/\varepsilon=1.4) to obtain a reasonable estimate of the equation of state (EOS) for ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\rho=\sigma^3N/V) ranging from 0.05 to 0.3.
2. Check by using the NTV ensemble that the densities which you obtained from previous steps are correct. In particular, for each density calculate the corresponding pressure and build the EOS. Them compare the latter EOS with the one obtained in (1).
